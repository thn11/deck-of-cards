# deck-of-cards
The deck of cards project lends itself to many card games. In this example a simple version of solitaire is being created.

Still to do:
* Make cards droppable on mouse release
* Create logic to controll which cards can be picked up
* Create logic and a highlight system for dropping cards
* Fix error where a new card is revealed upon picking up the last card, even if that card is not put down.
