# deck-of-cards
The project is designed to be as modular as possible. 
It would be a very simple thing to add both hands and decks, 
and each hand could pull a card from any deck. This is the 
reason the CSS is set to a grid layout, as this allows a 
programmer to easily add as many hands and decks as they 
want. 

This branch represents about 3 to 4 hours of work, and
implements the entire backend with a very basic UI. It
is missing the feature that allows a user to draw more
than one card at a time, but all other features have 
been implemented.
