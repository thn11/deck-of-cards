# deck-of-cards
The project is designed to be as modular as possible.
It would be a very simple thing to add both hands and decks,
and each hand could pull a card from any deck. This is the
reason the CSS is set to a grid layout, as this allows a
programmer to easily add as many hands and decks as they
want.

This branch will eventually be the GUI version of the
project.
